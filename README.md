# The Chat-in
The Chat'Inn is a simple and minimal realtime chat application whose database is powered by firebase and firestore. The frontend part is complete made using React.js and made responsive using normal css properties.

- My main aim was to learn firebase.
- By reading the official firebase documentation.
- And to implement a minimal chat interface using firebase.
